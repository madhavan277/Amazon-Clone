**Amazon Clone Webpage:**

This project is a detailed Amazon clone webpage developed as part of my journey into web development. Creating this project was both an engaging and challenging experience that greatly enhanced my understanding of modern web technologies and design principles.

**Learning Journey:**

Throughout the development process, I faced various challenges and obstacles. By leveraging online tutorials and video lessons, I was able to overcome these hurdles effectively. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Shraddha Khapra for her clear, insightful teaching, which made complex topics much easier to grasp and implement.

**Project Overview:**

Rather than building a simple landing page, I chose to replicate the Amazon homepage to better understand the complexities behind a large-scale e-commerce platform. This project allowed me to dive deep into UI/UX design, responsive layouts, and interactive features, providing practical experience in building user-centric web applications.
